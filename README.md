# LinearRegressionModel
A simple linear regression model that predicts percentage of a student on the basis of number of hours they study per day
. RMSE is around 27 at the best(quite high)
. *Edit: RMSE reduced to 5.37 :))*

Machine learning, more specifically the field of predictive modeling is primarily concerned with minimizing the error of a model or making the most accurate predictions possible, at the expense of explainability. In applied machine learning we will borrow, reuse and steal algorithms from many different fields, including statistics and use them towards these ends.
